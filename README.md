# Modeling Educational Data with Machine Learning Methods

## Overview
This project aims to model educational data using various machine learning methods. We compare the performance of different models and use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. The project involves several stages including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, data processing, and model evaluation.

We performed both regression and binary classification tasks using the following models:

## Regression Models
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor

## Binary Classification Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model is also optimized using GridSearchCV.

## Performance Metrics
The performance of each model is evaluated based on the following metrics:

### Regression Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R²)
- Adjusted R-squared (R²)

### Classification Metrics
- Recall
- Precision
- F1 Score
- Accuracy
- ROC AUC
- Log Loss
- Confusion Matrix

## Future Work
Future work may include testing additional machine learning models, using different methods for hyperparameter tuning, and building more models.
